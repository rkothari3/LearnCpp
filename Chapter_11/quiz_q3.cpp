Output and Explaination:

1
2
When count(1) is called, the compiler will instantiate the function count<int>(int) and call it. This will return value 1.

When count(1) is called again, the compiler will see that count<int>(int) already exists, and call it again. This will return value 2.

When count(2.3) is called, the compiler will instantiate the function with prototype count<double>(double) and call it. This is a new function with its own static c variable, so this will return value 1.

When count<double>(1) is called, the compiler will see that weâ€™re explicitly requesting the double version of count(). This function already exists due to the prior statement, so count<double>(double) will be called and the int argument will be implicitly converted to a double. This function will return value 2.
