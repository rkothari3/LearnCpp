#include <iostream>

using namespace std; // this is a using-directive that allows us to access names in the std namespace with no namespace prefix

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!"; // we no longer have to use std::cout
    return 0;
}

// BEST PRACTICE: Avoid using-directives with std because they violate the reason why namespaces were added in the first place.
